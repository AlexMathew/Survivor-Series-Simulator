{"name":"Survivor Series Simulator","tagline":"For your dream Survivor Series matchups","body":"# SURVIVOR SERIES SIMULATOR #\r\n\r\n#### Bringing together my love for pro-wrestling and programming. ####\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## THE INSPIRATION : ##\r\nEver wanted to have a Dream 5-on-5 Survivor Series match ?\r\n\r\nCM Punk, Daniel Bryan and Chris Jericho on the same team ?\r\n\r\nCan Vince McMahon, Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart get together on the same team ?\r\n\r\nHow would a team of Indy stars fare against WWE and TNA's top guns ?\r\n\r\nThis is your way to simulate those dream matchups ! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## THE PROGRAM RUN : ##\r\nRun the program through your command prompt. \r\n\r\nOnce you've opened the Survivor-Series-Simulator.py file , a Tkinter window opens, with a list of 125 wrestlers to choose from for your teams. I've allotted a rating for each of them. (Pro-wrestling purists may argue with me about some of the ratings. But my program, my ratings) Pick your team of 5, such that it doesn't exceed the maximum rating total of 43.5.\r\n\r\nOnce you've picked both your teams, and confirmed them, a new Tkinter window opens for the match run.\r\n\r\nIn the match run, use one of the 6 buttons to pick the type of moves. \r\n> + Basic\r\n> + Grapple\r\n> + Hold\r\n> + Aerial\r\n> + Finisher\r\n> + Tag \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the opponent, use the \"Finisher\" button to perform the wrestler's finisher.\r\nThe match continues until one of the teams is completely eliminated.\r\nOnce the match is finished, use the \"Import Commentary and Close Game\" button to save the commentary into a text file, in the directory you initially specified. Otherwise, hit \"Close Game\" to just close the game.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
